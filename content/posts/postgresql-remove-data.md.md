# üóÇÔ∏è Identifying Your TV Show Data in PostgreSQL

To locate the table where your TV show data is stored in PostgreSQL, follow these steps:

## Step 1: List All Tables in the Database üóÉÔ∏è

1. **Access the PostgreSQL Prompt**:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it riven-db psql -U postgres
   ```

2. **Connect to Your Database**:

   ```sql
   \c riven
   ```

3. **List All Tables**:

   Run the following command to view all tables in the current database:

   ```sql
   \dt
   ```

   This will display a list of tables along with their schema, name, type, and owner.

## Step 2: Examine Table Structure üîç

Once you have a list of tables, examine the structure of each to find the relevant columns for your TV show data.

1. **Describe a Table**:

   For example, to see the structure of the `tvshows` table:

   ```sql
   \d tvshows
   ```

   This command shows you the columns, their types, and any constraints (like primary keys).

## Step 3: Look for Relevant Columns üîë

When describing a table, look for columns that might contain your TV show data. Common names include:

- `title`
- `name`
- `show_name`
- `description`
- `genre`

## Example Workflow üõ†Ô∏è

Here‚Äôs how the entire process might look:

```bash
# Access the PostgreSQL prompt
docker exec -it riven-db psql -U postgres

# Connect to your database
\c riven

# List all tables
\dt

# Describe the 'tvshows' table to see its structure
\d tvshows
```

## Conclusion üèÅ

By following these steps, you can identify which table holds your TV show data and what columns are available for querying or deleting. If you find a table that seems relevant but you're unsure, feel free to share its structure, and I can help you interpret it!

## Troubleshooting Command Errors ‚ö†Ô∏è

If you encounter issues with the command you entered, here‚Äôs how to resolve them:

### Step 1: Ensure You Are in the Correct Environment ‚úÖ

Make sure you are in the PostgreSQL command prompt (`psql`). A prompt like `riven=#` indicates you‚Äôre in the right place.

### Step 2: Execute the Query Again üîÑ

Try running the query again:

```sql
SELECT _id FROM "MediaItem" WHERE title ILIKE '%Isekai%';
```

### Step 3: Verify the Output üìä

If the command executes successfully, it should return the `_id` of any media items that match the title. If there are no results, it will simply return an empty set.

---

## Checking for References to `_id = 3944` üîó

You‚Äôve successfully retrieved a list of tables referencing the `MediaItem` table. Here‚Äôs a summary:

| Table Name                | Column Name          |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Movie                     | _id                  |
| Show                      | _id                  |
| StreamBlacklistRelation    | media_item_id       |
| StreamRelation            | parent_id            |
| Subtitle                  | parent_id            |
| Season                    | _id                  |
| Episode                   | _id                  |

### Step 1: Query Each Table for `_id = 3944` üîç

Run `SELECT` queries on each of these tables:

1. **Movie**:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "Movie" WHERE _id = 3944;
   ```

2. **Show**:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "Show" WHERE _id = 3944;
   ```

3. **StreamBlacklistRelation**:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "StreamBlacklistRelation" WHERE media_item_id = 3944;
   ```

4. **StreamRelation**:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "StreamRelation" WHERE parent_id = 3944;
   ```

5. **Subtitle**:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "Subtitle" WHERE parent_id = 3944;
   ```

6. **Season**:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "Season" WHERE _id = 3944;
   ```

7. **Episode**:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "Episode" WHERE _id = 3944;
   ```

### Step 2: Execute Queries üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Run these queries one by one in your PostgreSQL prompt to check for any records associated with `_id = 3944`.

### Step 3: Review Results üìã

- Check each output to see if there are related records.
- If a table returns results, it indicates associations with the `MediaItem` having `_id = 3944`.

---

## Deleting Shows and Related Data üóëÔ∏è

If you need to delete entries, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Check Related Seasons üîé

First, identify which seasons reference this show:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Season" WHERE parent_id = 3944;
```

### Step 2: Delete Related Seasons ‚ùå

Once identified, delete those records:

```sql
DELETE FROM "Season" WHERE parent_id = 3944;
```

### Step 3: Delete the Show üé¨

After deleting related seasons, you can delete the show itself:

```sql
DELETE FROM "Show" WHERE _id = 3944;
```

### Complete Workflow üîÑ

1. **Check for Related Seasons**:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "Season" WHERE parent_id = 3944;
   ```

2. **Delete Related Seasons** (if found):

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM "Season" WHERE parent_id = 3944;
   ```

3. **Delete the Show**:

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM "Show" WHERE _id = 3944;
   ```

### Important Considerations ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Backup**: Always ensure you have a backup before performing delete operations.
- **Cascade Deletion**: Consider setting the foreign key constraint in the `Season` table to `ON DELETE CASCADE` for future deletions.

Here‚Äôs a more compact version for easy copy and paste:

```bash
docker exec -it riven-db psql -U postgres
```

SELECT * FROM "MediaItem" WHERE title ILIKE '%The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power%';
```

### Check Parent IDs

## üîç Info for Media Item `_id = 1314`

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Movie" WHERE _id = 1314;
SELECT * FROM "StreamBlacklistRelation" WHERE media_item_id = 1314;
SELECT * FROM "StreamRelation" WHERE parent_id = 1314;
SELECT * FROM "Subtitle" WHERE parent_id = 1314;
SELECT * FROM "Show" WHERE _id = 1314;
SELECT * FROM "Season" WHERE parent_id = 1314;

SELECT * FROM "Episode" WHERE parent_id = 1314;
```

## üóëÔ∏è Deleting Records
