# Docker Network Management Guide üöÄ

## Overview
Managing Docker networks effectively is crucial for avoiding conflicts, especially when creating new networks. This guide will help you troubleshoot and resolve network overlap issues, ensuring smooth operation.

---

## Common Error: Overlapping Subnets ‚ö†Ô∏è
When attempting to create a new Docker network, you may encounter the error:

```
failed to create network: Error response from daemon: Pool overlaps with other one on this address space
```

This error indicates that the subnet you're trying to use is already in use by another network.

---

## Steps to Resolve Overlapping Subnets üîç

### 1. List Existing Docker Networks
Start by listing all Docker networks to identify any that may be conflicting:
```bash
docker network ls
```

### 2. Inspect Each Network
To check the subnets of the existing networks, you can inspect them one by one:
```bash
docker network inspect <network_name>
```
Replace `<network_name>` with the name of the network.

### 3. Check for Conflicting Subnets
Look for the `IPAM` section in the output to find the `Subnet` field. Identify any networks using the same subnet.

### 4. Remove or Modify Conflicting Networks
If you find a conflicting network, you can remove it:
```bash
docker network rm <conflicting_network_name>
```

### 5. Create a New Network
After ensuring no conflicts, create your new network with a unique subnet:
```bash
docker network create --subnet=172.24.0.0/16 mediafusion_mediafusion_network
```

---

## Inspect All Networks at Once üîÑ
To check all Docker networks without inspecting one by one:

1. **Install `jq`** (Optional)
   If you want to filter output, install `jq`:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install jq
   ```

2. **Inspect All Networks**
   Use the following command:
   ```bash
   docker network ls -q | xargs docker network inspect | jq '.[] | {Name: .Name, Subnets: .IPAM.Config}'
   ```

### 3. Alternative Command Without `jq`
If you prefer not to install `jq`, run:
```bash
docker network ls -q | xargs docker network inspect | grep -E 'Name|Subnet'
```

---

## Example Output üìä
The output will look like this:
```json
{
  "Name": "mediafusion_default",
  "Subnets": [
    {
      "Subnet": "172.23.0.0/16",
      "Gateway": "172.23.0.1"
    }
  ]
}
```
This provides a clear view of each network and its associated subnets.

## Conclusion üéâ
By following this guide, you can effectively manage your Docker networks, resolve subnet overlaps, and ensure a smooth container orchestration experience. If you need further assistance, feel free to reach out!
